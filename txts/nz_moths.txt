Introduction 
The rates of biological invasions continue to increase globally (Seebens et 
al. 2021), causing significant disruption to ecosystems, habitat types and 
taxonomic groups (Essl et al. 2020). The transportation of species to 
regions beyond their natural range, is considered as a major driver of 
biodiversity change (Pyšek et al. 2020), such changes to biodiversity are 
most visible on geographically isolated islands, where high levels of 
endemism occur (Courchamp et al. 2003). New Zealand is considered a 
“biodiversity hotspot” due to its highly endemic biota (Myers et al. 2000), 
all of which have evolved in isolation from many of the invasive taxa 
present today (Allen & Lee 2006), and is a region which has been 
negatively affected by biological invasions (Simberloff 2019). In response 
to this, New Zealand is now widely regarded as a leading country on 
invasive species management and biosecurity (Simberloff 2019). In 1993, 
the Biosecurity Act was established, creating strict protocols around 
overseas goods entering the country in order to protect agriculture and 
biodiversity (Hulme 2020). Although costly, averaging $485 million NZD 
per year from 2017–2020 (New Zealand Government 2019), these 
protocols are implemented with the intention of avoiding greater future 
costs associated with managing or removing established invasive species. 
By examining Asian gypsy moth biological traits, regions of the world 
which are currently under invasion, and pathways of introduction, this 
study aims to determine if this species has the ability to establish in New 
Zealand, and the ecological impact the species could have.

Lymantria dispar asiatica biology  
Lymantria dispar, also known as gypsy moths or spongy moths, is a 
species of moth in the family Erebidae. Lymantria dispar is subdivided 
into three (but possibly more) subspecies, Lymantria dispar dispar 
(European gypsy moth, EGM), Lymantria dispar asiatica (Asian gypsy 
moth, AGM), and Lymantria dispar japonica (Japanese gypsy moth, JGM) 
(McCormick 2019, Djoumad 2017). There is a degree of uncertainty over 
the classification, as the subspecies are notably difficult to distinguish from 
one another, each showing strong variation in colour, wing pattern, and 
genitalia characteristics. Comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes 
conducted by Djoumad et al. (2017) showed potential usefulness in the 
identification of subspecies, however, the currently accepted biological 
distinctiveness is based upon sexual and functional dimorphism (flight 
capability of adult female moths), and distribution. The complete loss of 
flight ability in females is a key morphological trait that sets EGM apart 
from the other two subspecies. The females of AGM and JGM are flight 
capable and have comparatively larger wings and lower abdominal mass 
compared to EGM females, however, JGM’s range is believed to be 
restricted to Japan (McCormick 2019). 
Male AGM are comparatively smaller in size to the female (Fig. 1), 
antennae are bipectinated, abdomen is slender and brownish, forewings are 
very variable in colour, markings are brownish to blackish, with a thick 
darker band along the distal margin. Subbasal band near the costa, 
submarginal spots are variably developed V shaped marks, crescent shaped 
discal spot is also well-defined. Hindwings are yellowish to orange, 
usually with a darker band around wing margin (Horak et al. 2020). 
Female AGM abdomen is yellowish to white, and darker in the last 
abdominal segments. (Fig. 1). Forewings are yellowish to white, with few 
and faint brownish markings. Usually, a few faint darker spots near base, 
subbasal band present as a curved brown mark near costa. Antemedial 
band is faint, originating from middle of costa and is sharply angled. Faint 
postmedial band, thin, zig-zag line, angled and roughly parallel to 
antemedial band. A row of small dark marks along outer margin, and

brown crescentic discal marks are prominent. Hindwing whitish, with a 
series of dark small marginal spots, and a faint submarginal band (Horak et 
al. 2020). Adult moths do not feed, and live up to three weeks (Humble 
1994).

Female AGM emit sex pheromone cis-7, 8-epoxy-2-methyloctadecane 
soon after eclosion to attract males (Pogue & Schaefer 2007). This usually 
takes place during daytime, peaking in the late afternoon and followed by a 
secondary peak before midnight (Cardé et al. 1996).  Oviposition 
behaviour is variable over the wide distribution of this subspecies, with 
members of each region preferring different biotopes (Pogue & Schaefer 
2007). Across central Asia, egg masses are often placed on the underside 
of large pine tree branches (Fig. 2), while in Russia and Mongolia, oviposit 
in to crevasses on rocky outcrops, and occasionally directly on the soil 
under boulders (Hauck et al. 2008). These are sometimes found in such 
large concentrations, that egg masses are found on top of other eggs 
masses, each containing between 100-1000 eggs (Petrovskii 2010). In 
Siberia, egg masses can be found overwintering covered by accumulating 
snow. Experiments by Pogue and Schaefer (2007) found that those egg 
masses covered by snow are protected from extreme cold temperatures and 
desiccating winds, which caused significant egg mortality. They went on 
to conclude that temperature drops to the critical value of –29,9 °C leads to 
the death of 100 % of eggs, and the viability of eggs drops as they are 
exposed to longer periods of cold temperatures. 
AGM are known to have one generation per year (Petrovskii 2010), and 
between six or seven larval instars. Laval dispersal is aided by 
“ballooning”, larvae produce silk strands on which they suspend from, and 
are passively dispersed by the wind (Diss et al. 1996). Ballooning has been 
shown to allow larvae to travel around 5km per year to new infestations, 
but has been recorded at over 50km (ISSG 2023). Newly hatched 
caterpillars (2-3mm) are black and hairy, later developing to an easily 
recognisable final larval stage (60mm), usually charcoal grey but colour 
variation is quite common (Fig. 3). A double row of five blue and six red 
dots on its back, and a yellow middorsal longitudinal band extending along 
thoracic and abdominal segments (often faint). Setae are prominent along 
each abdominal segment, longer at the head and hind region (US 
Department of Agriculture, ISSG 2023). Larvae seek out protected 
locations when ready pupate, such as bark fissures, crevices and 
underneath loose moss. Pupae are dark reddish brown in colour, female

pupae are usually larger (15-35mm) than male (15-20mm).  The Pupal 
stages vary depending on sex, usually around 10 days for females and 13 
days for males (Humble & Stewart 1994).  
 
Lymantria dispar asiatica native range and ecological Impact 
AGM is widely distributed throughout Asia, the Russian Far East, 
Mongolia, the northern two thirds of China, and the Korean Peninsula 
(Pogue & Schaefer 2007). AGM have an extremely wide host range, with 
over 100 known hosts, and have been referred to as ‘superpolyphagous’ 
because of this (Horak et al. 2020). Cyclic population dynamics are well 
documented, low population levels can exist for many years, periodically 
population’s boom, causing extensive defoliation and damage until they 
decline. The natural enemies which occur in the native range of AGM, 
play different roles in regulating its populations. Birds feed on larvae, 
adults and egg masses during winter, rodents are reported to prey on larvae 
and pupae, along with spiders, assassin bugs, shield bugs and beetles 
(Baranchikov et al. 1998). More than 70 species, primarily tachinids (Fig. 
4), ichneumonids, and braconids, have been reported to attack the gypsy 
moth in Asia. Most of these parasitoids affect the larval and the pupal 
stages, but a few can parasitize eggs (Baranchikov et al. 1998). 
 
Lymantria dispar asiatica invasive distribution, ecological and 
economic Impact 
Over a century since AGM’s accidental introduction, North America 
(primarily the United States) (Fig. 5) has found AGM to be of serious 
concern, damaging both commercial and native forest ecosystems (Hajek 
& Tobin 2009). Population booms have led to the serious defoliation and 
weakening of trees and shrubs, often leading to tree death directly or 
indirectly by subsequent infestation by a secondary pest (Srivastava, 
2020). The impact on crop yields, and economic costs associated with 
monitoring and controlling the invasive species are high. Eradication of

two introductions in the early 1990’s involved costs totalling US$ 34 
million (Krcmar-Nozic et al. 2000). Long distance pathway vectors, 
primarily shipping and cargo containers arriving from ships arriving from 
ports of known to be within AGM’s native range, are believed to be the 
source of establishment (Areces-Berazain, 2022).  
 
Potential establishment of Lymantria dispar asiatica in New Zealand 
The global shipping network is widely recognised as a pathway for 
vectoring AGM, and with the growing number of international ships 
whose first port of call to vulnerable ports (i.e., a port where AGM is 
established) before arriving in New Zealand, led to the Ministry of Primary 
Industries (MPI) launching a national trapping programme in March 1993. 
Monitoring of incoming goods from vulnerable ports has shown that in 
2000 to 2002, 124 inceptions of AGM (107 egg masses, 9 larvae, 7 pupae 
and one adult) (Ross 2005), yet despite this, it was 10 years after 
implementation of the trapping programme that the first ever gypsy moth 
was discovered in the North Island city of Hamilton (MPI, 2023), and 
since then no further AGM’s have been found. 
Paini et al. (2018) used the Matsuki CLIMEX model to estimate those 
areas that are climatically suitable for AGM establishment (Fig. 6), 
showing conditions across North and South East New Zealand to be 
habitable. The strongest predictors and limitations of AGM potential range 
and dispersal being annual and seasonal precipitation, and regions which 
experience longer periods of temperatures ≥30 °C (optimum temperature 
conditions for AGM survival being 15- 25 °C) (Srivastava 2020). Yet the 
risk of AGM establishing in native forests may be low due to poor larval 
performance on native plants, with only one species of native tree 
(Nothofagus solandri) proving to be a successful host (Matsuki et al. 
2001). The risk of establishment in urban environments and agricultural 
land, which support high quantities of exotic plants known to be host 
species, could be significantly higher (list of known hosts which are 
present in New Zealand are shown in appendix 1.)

There are a number of biological traits which provide strong dispersal 
methods, making AGM of even greater concern if becoming established. 
There is evidence to show that a proportion of AGM eggs do not undergo 
obligatory diapause and they hatch over a longer period, increasing the 
chance of introduction to new environments if pupae are undetected (Glare 
et al. 1998). The absence of natural enemies in New Zealand, decreases 
population suppression, increasing the potential long-term population

fluctuations which are observed in North America, which is notable 
especially in the first few years after introduction (Glare et al. 1998). 
Larvae “ballooning” could drastically increase the initial range of 
establishment, and push the species in to new territory with ease. The 
volume of eggs which females are capable of ovipositing and the positing 
of these, could lead to populations surviving and thriving in areas of 
suitable hosts, proving very difficult to remove.   
These findings suggest that surveillance, continued monitoring, and strict 
biosecurity checks are crucial to prevent AGM entering New Zealand’s 
borders. Moreover, as the global patterns of AGM invasions continue, and 
likely advances and frequency of international trade to New Zealand 
persist, further trapping programmes across regions would be key to 
lowering the risk of establishment.
