Abstract
Tourism, one of the world largest economic sectors, moves a substantial body of individuals
and materials about the world and is implicated in the spread of invasive plants and is itself
impacted by biological invasions that can degrade touristic landscapes and affect destination
communities. Tourists constitute not only an immediate biological threat, but through their
landscape and biota preferences also constitute a substantial economic and ecological force that
has implications for invasive plant management in destinations. Tourists and the tourism
industry are therefore significant stakeholders in invasive plant introduction, spread, and
management. This paper discusses an onsite survey (n = 231) of domestic and international
visitors in New Zealand, a destination where invasive species are an important ecological and
economic issue. Findings show that visitors have a low understanding of the presence and level
of threat of invasive plants and express preferences for some plants that are highly invasive.
However, there were substantial variations across the international sample, with visitors from
Asian and European ethnicities expressing significantly different attitudes toward a range of
invasive plants. Asian visitors were more likely to show preferences for some plants that were
seriously invasive and to be more accepting in general of invasive plants within landscapes and
less supportive of invasive species eradication. These findings suggest that attitudes toward
invasive plants and their management may be culturally determined, which poses challenges for
managers aiming to generate awareness and support from across diverse tourist cohorts for
invasive species control. There are also challenges for gaining support from the tourism
industry for invasive plant control programs where particular “charismatic” or attractive
invasive plants may contribute to touristic landscapes and visitor itineraries.
Introduction
New Zealand is an island nation supporting a relatively high number of endemic species
(McNeely 2011). Tourism is the nation’s major export earner (until the impacts of COVID-19)
and relies heavily on New Zealand’s endemic fauna and flora, its landscape, and the nation’s
100% pure and green image (Hayes and Lovelock 2017). However, New Zealand has been
profoundly affected by invasive alien species (IAS), particularly since the early 19th century
following European colonization (Beattie 2011). Many areas of New Zealand now comprise
mixed biodiversity with native and introduced species (De Lange et al. 2009). Yet we know very
little about how tourists perceive our “invaded” landscapes or the extent to which they may
support IAS management—especially if this impacts upon tourist vistas.
Decisions about IAS management are largely based on stakeholders’ perceptions of their
impacts (Shackleton et al. 2019a). However, attitudes toward IAS can be diverse and are
influenced by a range of factors (Shackleton et al. 2019a, 2019b). Some IAS may even be
perceived as having both positive and negative impacts (Kourantidou et al. 2022). This means
that successful IAS management is often challenging because of the disparate values of multiple
social groups or stakeholders (Fall 2021; McNeely 2011; Shackleton et al. 2007). Thus,
incorporating stakeholder perspectives is considered to be critical to the success of IAS
management (Head 2017; Warren 2001).
Tourism is a globally important activity involving the international movement of 1.4 billion
people and domestic movement of 9 billion people (pre-Covid 19; UNWTO 2020). This
movement significantly contributes to, and is affected by, biological invasions (Anderson et al.
2015; Barros et al. 2022; Hall and Baird 2013; Oded and Ram 2015; Pickering and Mount 2010).
Invasive species can decrease the overall naturalness and biodiversity (Villéger and Brosse 2012)
that many sites rely on as elements of their destination competitiveness (Lovelock 2007). IAS can
also impact landscape aesthetics and degrade the ecosystem services that support tourism
activities (Hall 2015). Conversely, some IAS are perceived to enhance destinations from the

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
perspectives of both the visitor and the tourist industry and have
become entrenched and valued as attractions or tourism products
(Hayes et al. 2023; Shackleton 2019b).
However, compared with our ecological understanding of
invasives, relatively little is known about the critical social
dimensions of IAS (Yletyinen et al. 2021) and particularly about
tourists’ perceptions of IAS (Nikodinoska et al. 2014). Research on
tourists instead more broadly addresses biosecurity perceptions
and behaviors (e.g., Kim et al. 2021; Melly and Hanrahan 2020).
While we do know that environmentally engaged visitors may be
more aware of IAS and supportive of management (Johnson 2022;
Rossi et al. 2022), our knowledge of how attitudes toward IAS vary
across social groups is limited. Yet this is potentially important, not
only because of the cross-national nature of tourism, but also
because of our increasingly culturally and ethnically diverse
societies (e.g., Gest 2021). If IAS managers are to develop
messaging that resonates across and within different social groups,
then it is important to research the IAS perceptions and attitudes
held by different social groups. Research already suggests that
nature and landscape preferences can vary across social groups, for
example, by race/ethnicity (Buijs 2009; Buijs et al. 2009; Virden
and Walker 1999). Likewise, the IAS literature acknowledges that
because perceptions are socially and culturally constructed,
individuals from different backgrounds and with different demo-
graphic profiles may be expected to have different perceptions of IAS
and different attitudes toward their management (Shackleton et al.
2019b). This has empirical support in some IAS research, for
example, Solano et al.’s (2022) recent study on firewood and IAS
translocation, which revealed race and education as the strongest
predictors of behavior. However, we have yet to fully explore
potential sociodemographic links with IAS awareness and attitudes.
Ethnicity and Attitudes toward Nature and IAS
Considering the focus of this study, to compare national/ethnic
understandings of and attitudes toward IAS, we draw upon
literature that more broadly considers ethnic/racial comparisons of
nature preferences. Previous research has found distinct variations
in nature/landscape preferences according to ethnicity and cultural
background (Buijs et al. 2009; Herzog et al. 2000; Kaplan and
Herbert 1987; Lovelock et al. 2011; Yu 1995). The majority of
studies on this topic have been undertaken in North America and
focus on differences between African American, Hispanic, and
White ethnic/racial groups (e.g., Taylor 2018; Virden and Walker
1999; for an overview of this body of research, see Whiting
et al. 2017).
But more fundamentally, it has been argued that human–nature
relationships vary cross-culturally. In Western societies, this is
conceptualized as a human–nature separation (Bruun and Kalland
2014; Kellert et al. 1995), wherein authentic nature from a Western
perspective is often portrayed as “wild” and “pristine,” free from
human-related influences and impacts (e.g., Johnson et al. 2005).
However, many non-Western and indigenous cultures consider
nature and the environment as being intertwined with the human
world, for example, Māori in Aotearoa New Zealand (Harmsworth
and Awatere 2013).
Similarly, Asian perspectives of nature, which are particularly
articulated in Buddhism, Daoism, and Hinduism, portray humans
and the natural environment as a harmonious unity (Bruun and
Kalland 2014; Harper and Snowden 2017; Kellert et al. 1995; Tu
1989). Empirical research does lend support to this view; for
example, a study of Asian New Zealanders’ relationships with
nature suggests that their experiences are less reliant on
perceptions of naturalness (ecological integrity) (Lovelock et al.
2011), a finding reinforced by Packer et al. (2014) with Chinese
visitors in Australia. But how such an Asian cosmology of human–
nature relations may specifically impact perceptions of IAS has not
been explored. Han (2006) contends that the relationship Chinese
have with animals and plants differs from that of Westerners
in that it hinges on understanding what enjoyment the animal or
plant might provide; the Chinese are not interested in the plant or
animal for its intrinsic value. Its invasive status may therefore be
irrelevant.
Of course, to consider that all Chinese (or all Asians) subscribe
to a consistent human–nature cosmology runs the risk of
essentializing Chinese-ness and/or Asian-ness (Li et al. 2021),
Management Implications
The fiscal and political realities of invasive plant management
mean that invasive plant managers need to engage more closely with
their stakeholders, as invasive plant control is sometimes viewed as
unnecessary or as itself being environmentally harmful. Where
invasive plants exist within tourist destinations, this means engaging
with visitors in order to:
• increase awareness of invasive plants and the need for their
management;
• enlist visitors as “citizen scientists” and/or as volunteers in
detection and control of invasive plants; and
• build a constituency of support for ongoing funding of invasive
plant management.
To engage effectively with visitors, however, requires an in-depth
understanding of those visitors and how they perceive invasive
plants, and what their attitudes are toward invasive plant control. As
few studies have explored tourists’ awareness of, attitudes toward,
and understanding of invasive plants, this research contributes in
two major ways; first by alerting managers to the generally low level
of awareness and understanding of invasive plants among visitors.
Managers cannot assume that even local visitors will recognize the
threats from some invasive plants, particularly those that are
perceived as “attractive.” Second, the study demonstrates that
tourists cannot be treated as a homogenous cohort—visitors from
different countries and ethnicities may not have a shared awareness
of the invasive plant problem or, importantly, a shared under-
standing of the importance of invasive plant control.
The implications of the above are:
1. Managers need to adopt different approaches for different
tourist segments in order to provide convincing and effective
messaging regarding the invasive plant problem.
2. Managers may need to take cultural advice upon how best to
communicate such messages.
3. Managers will need to work with the tourism industry (i.e.,
tourist guides and companies) to identify the best mechanisms
for engaging with a diverse cohort of visitors.
4. Managers will need to consider how they “counteract”
information (e.g., imagery from tourism social media) that
celebrates the existence of some “charismatic” or attractive
invasive plants where those plants are entrenched within
tourist itineraries.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
just as it would be a generalization to say that all Westerners
subscribe to the human–nature dichotomy described earlier. From
the perspective of this research, these are merely labels to be used as
convenient starting points to explore whether and how attitudes
to IAS may vary. Meanwhile, complicating attempts to draw
conclusions regarding the relationship between race/ethnicity and
attitudes toward nature (and IAS) are previous findings suggesting
that other demographic factors may also play a role; for example,
gender and age have also been found to influence individuals’
perceptions of nature and naturalness (Norgaard 2007; Sang
et al. 2016).
Studies of Tourists and Invasive Species
There are limited studies of tourists’ perceptions of and attitudes
toward nature and environmental management that have a focus
on invasive species. Barros et al.’s (2022) edited collection on
tourism, recreation, and biological invasions is a welcome addition
and includes a useful summary of work in this area (Shackleton
et al. 2022). Those studies that do address invasive species (e.g.,
Ansong and Pickering 2015; Bravo-Vargas et al. 2019; Zhang et al.
2021) reveal variation in the way that visitors assess the threat from
such species. For example, Sharp et al. (2011) found that visitors
with higher levels of formal education and a biocentric value
orientation indicated more support for certain invasive species
control measures.
Nanayakkara et al. (2018) found that visitors’ understandings of
aquatic invasive species in Canada was organism dependent, but also
connected with several demographic (age, sex, and education)
variables, including place of residence (rural vs. urban); however,
they found that race had no measurable effect. In their qualitative
study of international visitors in eco-sanctuaries in New Zealand,
Zhang et al. (2021) did, however, find examples of nationality (and
familiarity with the species) influencing visitors’ attitudes toward
particular IAS. Likewise, other research on tourists in New Zealand
has demonstrated variation between domestic and international
tourists in their level of ecological knowledge, attitudes toward
nature, and attitudes toward invasive species and their control
(Lovelock 2007). However, in that study, international visitors were
examined as one social group, and ethnic or cultural differences were
not considered. While not addressing IAS specifically, Packer et al.
(2014) found differences in attitudes toward nature among visitors
based upon nationality and ethnicity.
A simple explanation for such variation in tourists’ attitudes
regarding IAS may be that they just have a lower level of awareness of
IAS and the problems they cause within the destination regions that
they are visiting. This may account for any domestic/international
variation in attitudes. However, some researchers (e.g., Vining et al.
2008) claim that due to industrialization, urbanization, and
disconnection from the natural environment, even the domestic
general public may not recognize the threat from IAS. For
international tourists, however, this is likely to be exacerbated by
their visits taking place within unfamiliar ecosystems.
Collectively, the literature cited suggests that visitors’ percep-
tions of and attitudes toward IAS may be linked with a range of
demographic factors, including place of residence and race/
ethnicity. Therefore, there is a need to investigate visitors’
understandings of IAS and how this may vary across the range
of visitors that the destination typically receives. This information
may help in the development
of appropriate
IAS-related
communication strategies for different visitor groups (Zhang
et al. 2021). This is particularly important for destinations such as
New Zealand, where IAS pose a significant ecological and
economic problem and where there is a large and diverse inbound
market of nature-based tourists. Previous studies have addressed
public opinion on invasive species and their control in New
Zealand (W Fraser 2001; A Fraser 2006; Russell 2014), but limited
research has been undertaken on tourists and the tourism industry
in relation to IAS (Gawith et al. 2020; Lovelock 2007; Lovelock
et al. 2022).
Consequently, this research aims to address gaps in our
knowledge regarding cultural variation in perceptions of IAS, with
a focus on tourists and their attitudes toward invasive plant
management—specifically addressing the influence of visitor
status (domestic/international) and sociodemographic factors
such as nationality and ethnicity. This study extends the social
dimensions of invasive species research into the tourism sphere
and provides insights for agencies tasked with IAS management,
where tourists and the tourism industry are critical stakeholders.
Materials and Methods
The aim of this research was to describe and compare visitors’
perceptions (awareness, attitudes, values) of the natural environ-
ment and a range of introduced plant species based upon different
sociodemographics defined by place of origin, ethnicity, age and
gender.
Thus,
descriptive
and
comparative
methods
were
considered most appropriate for this study, as they are commonly
used in the social sciences to compare similarities and differences
among groups (Williams 2007).
A questionnaire was developed for the purpose of the study,
with some items broadly developed from Lovelock (2007), but the
questionnaire was expanded and adapted to focus on flora rather
than fauna and to include species that could commonly be
expected to be encountered by visitors in their travels through
New Zealand (see supplementary material). The questionnaire also
drew broadly on other social dimensions studies on invasive plants
(e.g., Bravo-Vargas et al. 2019; Lindemann-Matthies 2016). The
first section aimed to examine participants’ preferences for a range
of commonly encountered flora in their New Zealand itineraries.
The rationale for this being that we need to know about visitors’
perceptions of and attitudes to commonly encountered invasive
plants in order to develop appropriate environmental messaging
for visitors around invasive plant management (ultimately with the
aim of building a constituency of support from visitors for invasive
plant management). For this section, we adopted a photo-
elicitation approach (Harper 2002), noting that this has been
used successfully in other studies of invasive species (e.g., Lovelock
2007; Zhang et al. 2021). Ten images of plants commonly found in
New Zealand were presented to participants. Among these plants,
beech forest (Nothofagus spp.) was the only native species, the
remainder—mixed pasture grass, Scottish thistle [Cirsium vulgare
(Savi) Ten.], pine forest (Pinus spp.), mixed exotic coniferous
forest (Pinus spp., Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco) gorse
(Ulex
europaeus
L.),
willows
(Salix
spp.),
Russell
lupin
(Lupinus polyphyllus Lindl.), wild exotic conifers (Pinus spp.,
Larix decidua Mill.)—all introduced, with the latter four species
also being invasive. Participants were asked to rate each plant using
a 5-point scale (1 = do not like at all, 5 = like very much). One of
the 10 photos (Figure 1G) contained wild conifers, but these were
set within a native grassland landscape, and participants appeared
to experience some confusion, many asking the surveyors which
species their responses should be based on. Thus, the responses to
this image were excluded from the analysis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The second section aimed to examine participants’ perceptions
(values, beliefs, and attitudes) of “naturalness” (natural environ-
ment) in relation to the presence of introduced species. A set of 12
statements covered the following aspects: participants’ knowledge of
New Zealand’s IAS (4 items); participants’ beliefs about the natural
environment (4 items); and their attitudes toward invasive species
and their control (4 items). For all 12 statements, participants were
asked to rate the extent of their agreement on a 5-point Likert-type
scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree). The final section
contained sociodemographic questions addressing visitor status
(domestic/international), nationality, ethnicity, gender, age, and
whether they were a member of any environmental group.
The questionnaire was conducted in both English and in
Mandarin, because Chinese visitors are the second largest tourist
group in New Zealand (MBIE 2018). The questionnaire was
originally designed in English and then was translated into
Mandarin. Independent back-translation was undertaken to check
consistency, and a pilot study was conducted with 12 Chinese
individuals to ensure it was perceived by Chinese respondents
correctly. Interviews were conducted with participants individually
to determine whether they had any difficulties understanding the
survey content. No key issues or problems were indicated by
respondents during the pilot study. As this study required
collection of primary data from human participants, ethical
approval was gained before the distribution of the pilot and main
surveys (University of Otago, approval D18/029). The aim of the
research project was disclosed to participants before they started
the survey through an information sheet provided on-site.
Participants were assured anonymity in the final report and could
choose at any time to withdraw from the survey.
Study Location
This study took place within two tourism regions in Te
Waipounamu the South Island of New Zealand: Te Manahuna
Mackenzie Basin and the Queenstown Lakes district (Figure 2).
Both regions have spectacular natural landscapes and are
important tourism destinations for both international and
domestic tourists, being popular for sightseeing, camping, hiking,
fishing, hunting, cycling, water sports, and snow sports (Gawith
et al. 2020). Aoraki/Mt Cook (New Zealand’s highest mountain
and a key attraction in Te Manahuna Mackenzie Basin) was visited
by more than 1 million visitors in 2018, and Queenstown (New
Zealand’s premier resort town) received 3.9 million visitors in 2019
(MBIE 2018; Sage 2019). Both areas have important historical,
spiritual, and cultural significance to the indigenous Māori of Te
Rūnanga o Ngai Tāhu, the local iwi (tribal group) (Greenaway
et al. 2015).
The landscapes of both regions have been through substantial
changes for a variety of reasons, including the damming of lakes
and canal system construction for hydroelectricity, expansion of
farming, intensive grazing, and planting of exotic conifers
(Thompson 2011). Much native vegetation has been replaced by
introduced plant species over the last 100 yr. Wild conifers (mainly
Pinus, Larix, and Pseudotsuga spp.) have become problematic,
spreading rapidly, eliminating native plants, and undermining the
naturalness and uniqueness of landscapes (Dickie et al. 2014;
Howell 2016). Similarly, L. polyphyllus, a decorative perennial
garden plant, invades the braided riverbeds that are characteristic
of the region, reducing the nesting habitat for birds, while
providing refuge for introduced predators.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The survey was distributed during the summers of 2019 and
2020 at popular viewpoint sites near Queenstown and Arrowtown
and at Twizel and Lake Pukaki in Te Manahuna Mackenzie Basin,
where most of the visitors to these areas would stop for photo-
taking opportunities. A convenience sampling technique was used
to recruit the next available visitor at the viewpoint site who was
willing to take part in the survey (Etikan et al. 2016). Surveys were
self-completed, mainly via iPad (hard copies were available for
respondents who preferred this medium). There were two
researchers on site distributing the survey to visitors. One of the
researchers was Mandarin speaking. Fruit and candy were available
as incentives for survey participants.
SPSS v. 24 was used for data analysis. Normality was assessed by
examining the skew and kurtosis values for all scale items (Fields
2013). All items met Kline’s (2010) criteria of skew less than 3 and
kurtosis less than 10, indicating normally distributed data.
Descriptive techniques were utilized to compute frequencies and
means for responses within each response category for all
questions by sociodemographic group. Independent t-tests (with
equal variances not assumed) and one-way ANOVA tests (with the
Bonferroni post hoc test) were utilized to determine the
significance of differences in the mean scores of participants’
ecological knowledge and participants’ perceptions of the natural
environment and introduced species among segregated groups
defined by sociodemographics.
Results and Discussion
Demographic Profile of Participants
Of the 238 responses, seven were either not fully completed or
demographic information was incomplete, reducing the effective
sample size to 231. A series of post hoc analyses were conducted
using G*Power (Faul et al. 2009) to determine the adequacy of the
achieved sample size for the statistical tests of the study. Table 1
summarizes the tests conducted, settings used according to
accepted conventions, and level of power achieved. The tests
showed that the sample size of 231 produced suitable power levels
for the statistical tests in this study.
The majority of the visitors (about three-quarters of the sample)
were international, with New Zealand domestic visitors compris-
ing the remaining one-quarter of the sample (Table 2).
There were slightly more female respondents than male
respondents. The number of “other” gender group respondents
(n = 3, 1.3%) was limited in the sample, precluding this as a
category for comparative statistical analysis. Visitors in the 18- to
29-yr-old range formed the largest age group, comprising more
than one-third of the sample, followed by the 30- to 39-yr-old
group. Of the international visitors, the majority came from
Europe, followed by China, then other Asia, Australia, and North
America. Visitors were mainly of two ethnicities, with European
comprising just under half of the sample, followed by Asian at
42.4%. There were limited numbers of Māori and Pasifika
participants in this study (about 2%), precluding comparative
statistical analysis of these groups, thus it was decided to combine
them with the “other” ethnicity group.
Visitors’ Plant Preferences
Participants were asked to rank the degree to which they liked each
plant in the group of plants described earlier, using a 5-point
scale (1 = don’t like at all, 5 = like very much). Results show
significantly different preference patterns between domestic
visitors (New Zealanders) and international visitors (Table 3).
New Zealand native beech forest (the only native plant in the
selection) was rated highest by New Zealand domestic participants,
while international participants rated L. polyphyllus as their
favorite. International participants reported a higher mean score

for five exotic species: L. polyphyllus, pine forest, exotic forest,
C. vulgare, and U. europaeus.
When the data were analyzed by nationality (Table 4),
significantly higher preferences were shown by visitors from
China and other Asia for five introduced species, including
invasive wild conifers.
Participants of different ethnicities also showed significantly
different preference patterns (Table 5). While the only native plant
in the sample (beech forest) received the highest ranking by
European ethnicity participants, those of Asian ethnicity ranked
the invasive L. polyphyllus their favorite. Asian visitors had
significantly higher preferences than participants of European
ethnicity for seven of the eight listed introduced species:
L. polyphyllus, pasture grass, wild conifer, pine forest, exotic
forest, C. vulgare, and U. europaeus.
Male participants and female participants showed some
significant differences: female participants rated L. polyphyllus
the highest out of all plant species, rating this invasive species
significantly higher than did male participants. Three species were
rated significantly differently by participants based on their ages,
with older participants showing lower preferences for two invasive
species (U. europaeus and C. vulgare). There were no significant
differences for plant preferences between environmental group
members and nonmembers.
Visitors’ Knowledge of Invasive Species in New Zealand
Participants’ knowledge of the extent of the IAS problem in
New Zealand landscapes was examined through four statements.
For each statement, participants were asked to rate their extent of
agreement using a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly agree,
5 = strongly disagree). Differences among social groups defined
by demographics were examined utilizing comparative analyses
(t-test, one-way ANOVA test). Generally, participants tended to
rate New Zealand’s habitats as being highly natural and pure;
international visitors significantly more so than domestic visitors.
Participants showed some level of awareness of ecological
problems facing New Zealand in terms of IAS. Domestic visitors
showed better knowledge of New Zealand’s natural environment
and a higher level of awareness of ecological problems facing
New Zealand than international visitors (Table 6).
For international visitors, knowledge of New Zealand’s
natural environment varied according to nationality (Table 7).
Participants from China and other Asia (significantly more so than
other international groups) tended to rate New Zealand’s land-
scape as being highly natural and pristine and New Zealand’s
landscapes as being more natural than those found overseas.
In the analysis by ethnicity, Asian participants tended to rate
New Zealand’s landscapes as highly natural and pristine and
having greater biodiversity than overseas landscapes (Table 8).
Asian participants also showed lower awareness of the ecological
problems facing New Zealand than European participants. There
were no significant differences among age groups or by gender or
environmental group membership.

Visitors’ Views on Invasive Species and Their Management
Participants were given eight statements related to IAS and
ecosystem management in general. Significant differences were
found between domestic and international visitors for three items
(Table 9). New Zealand visitors were less likely to accept long-
standing invasive plants as native species and more likely to support
their eradication and the active management of ecosystems.
Participants from China and other Asians showed higher
acceptance of introduced species and less support for eradication
(Table 10). They more strongly supported the statements “There is
no bad plant or animal species” and “If an introduced plant or
animal is in a place long enough, we can eventually consider it to be
natural.” Compared with participants from Australia, Europe, and
North America, they were also more likely to acknowledge the
difficulty and cost of invasive species management.
Significantly different responses were also received from
respondents of Asian ethnicity compared with other ethnicity
groups for six items (Table 11). In a similar manner to responses by
nationality, Asian participants demonstrated higher tolerance and
acceptance of introduced species than European participants.
While there were no significant differences by gender, there
were differences among age groups for a number of items. Those
from the 30- to 39-yr-old and 40- to 49-yr-old groups showed less
support for eradication of invasive species than other age groups.
Participants in the 30- to 39-yr-old group seemed to more strongly
support the view that “There is no such thing as a ‘bad’ plant or
animal species” than those from other age groups. This group also
seemed to have greater concerns about the difficulty of IAS control
than the older age groups. Older participants (50- to 59-yr-old)
showed less support for the statement “If an introduced plant or
animal is in a place long enough, we can eventually consider it to be
natural.” Non–environmental group members showed a higher
tolerance of the spread of pests and weeds into the natural
environment than did members, while also showing stronger
agreement with the statement “There is no such thing as a bad
plant or animal species.”

Visitors’ “IAS Orientation”
A mean score was calculated from the latter four of the eight items
specifically referring to the place of invasive species in the
environment to create an “IAS orientation” scale. Cronbach’s
alpha (α = 0.808) indicated that the internal consistency of the
scale is acceptable. The scale gives an overall indication of each
participant’s position regarding IAS; the lowest possible score of
1 on this scale indicates an acceptance of IAS, and the highest
possible score of 5 indicates a desire to eradicate IAS (Table 12).
Overall, participants were moderately unaccepting of IAS, but
there were significant differences between groups. New Zealand
tourists were significantly less accepting of IAS than were
international tourists. Similarly, there was a significant difference
in means among international groups; participants from China
and other Asians scored significantly lower than visitors of other
nationalities, indicating higher acceptance of IAS than other
international groups. There was also a significant difference in
means among the three ethnicity groups. Asian participants

showed a higher level of acceptance of IAS than those from
European and other ethnicities.
Older visitors (above 50 yr old) had lower tolerance and
acceptance of IAS than younger age groups (under 50 yr old).
There was no difference between males and females in mean scores
for IAS orientation. However, participants who were environ-
mental group members scored differently from nonmembers,
being less accepting of IAS.
The study revealed that many tourists, especially international
tourists, had low awareness of the ecological problems associated
with IAS and that their expressed preferences for commonly
encountered New Zealand flora included a number of serious
environmental weeds. These preferences, however, varied signifi-
cantly among participants by visitor origin and ethnicity. Many
international participants were unclear about the extent of the
invasive plant problem in New Zealand. This may be associated
with New Zealand’s hybridized landscapes that support a wide
range of invasive alien species. Adding to this confusion, some of
these invasive plants, (e.g., L. polyphyllus), were historically spread
for the purpose of landscape “improvements” and for tourism.
Thus, international visitors encountering such plants in touristic
locations that otherwise have a high degree of natural integrity may
believe they are native plants. In fact L. polyphyllus received
very high preferences from both domestic and international
participants—most likely because of their attractive flowers. This
supports the view that certain traits of species (i.e., aesthetic value
of flowering plants) may influence visitors’ perceptions and
attitudes toward particular invasive species and their management
(Knight 2008; Shackleton et al. 2019b). Further to this, the
legitimacy of L. polyphyllus in the landscape is perpetuated by its
ubiquitous (and largely unchallenged) presence in formal and
informal touristic imagery (Hayes et al. 2023). This poses a
challenge for managers wishing to eradicate an attractive species
that now features in the itineraries of many tourists.
Importantly, international participants showed significantly
lower support for eradication of IAS than did domestic participants.
This may be attributed to a lower awareness of the ecological
problems associated with IAS. However, when considering different
visitor groups—defined by nationality and ethnicity—differences in
participants’ ecological knowledge and awareness of ecological
problems were apparent. Participants from China and from
other Asian countries not only showed a poorer knowledge of
New Zealand’s flora and a lower awareness of the impacts caused by
invasive plant species compared with participants from other
international groups, but also demonstrated higher preferences for
some invasiveplants. Most importantly, however, the IAS orientation
results for Asian participants indicated higher levels of acceptance of
IAS in general than did the results for European participants.
These variations along ethnic lines support previous studies
undertaken with residents in which individuals from different
ethnicities have expressed distinct preferences for the natural
environment and landscapes (e.g., Buijs et al. 2009; Herzog et al.
2000; Kaplan and Herbert 1987; Lovelock et al. 2011; Virden and
Walker 1999). Similarly, Zhang et al. (2021) found variation
between Asian and Western visitors to eco-sanctuaries regarding
perceptions and attitudes toward some endemic and introduced
species. In our study, the differences between Asian and European
ethnicities and in particular the Asian visitors’ significantly
different IAS orientation scores, pose some questions about
ethnicity and human–nature relations. If we accept that the Asian
cosmology of human–nature relations is different from, and more
environmentally aligned than, the Western cosmology (Harper
and Snowden 2017), this may in part explain these findings.
However, the Asian human–nature cosmology could manifest
in different ways in terms of Asian orientation toward IAS.
This critically depends upon how “nature” is defined. If nature in
the Asian cosmology is taken to mean exclusively “natural nature”
(i.e., indigenous vs. introduced), then we could expect in our survey
results a closer alignment between Asian and European visitors’
preferences, attitudes, and their IAS orientations. But this was not
the case, thus suggesting that “nature” in the Asian cosmology is
more all-encompassing, not distinguishing between indigenous
and introduced—a sort of “place for everything,” rather than
“everything in its place” approach. This finding is supported by
Lovelock et al. (2011), who reported that Asian New Zealanders’
experiences of nature-based recreation were less reliant on
perceptions of naturalness, and human presence in nature was
acceptable and even desirable. Similarly, Packer et al. (2014) found
that Chinese visitors had a more anthropocentric view of nature
than did Australian visitors. Han (2006) contends that the
relationship Chinese have to animals and plants is one that hinges
on understanding what enjoyment the animal or plant might
provide. Under this assumption, the Chinese are not interested in
the plant or animal for its intrinsic value. Rather, if the plant can
bring pleasure through its presence in the landscape (e.g., a hillside
of attractive yet invasive wilding conifers, or a riverbed abundant
with the beautiful flowering yet invasive L. polyphyllus) then its
invasive status is irrelevant.
Challenging these assumptions is not only the homogenization
of “Asian” or “Western” but also the view that the East–West
distinctions in human–nature relations may be a fiction in
contemporary globalized society (e.g., see Bruun and Kalland
2014). Furthermore, the rapid industrialization and urbanization
experienced in many Asian countries in recent decades has meant
that over time people have started to lose their connections with,
and knowledge about, the natural environment and the processes
that support ecosystems—mirroring such trends in Western
societies (Vining et al. 2008).
Further confounding any ethnicity- or nationality-based
differences in perceptions of IAS are other sociodemographic
factors; in this study, participants in the older age group (above 50 yr)
demonstrated better knowledge of plant origins and a higher
awareness of ecological impacts of invasive plant species. This
aligns with previous studies concerning intentions to support
invasive species management (e.g., Bremner and Park 2007), which
have found that sociodemographic factors, including age and
gender affected support—with those from older age groups being
willing to pay more for invasive species management (Garcia-
Llorente et al. 2011). However, this study aligns (partly) with
previous research that has found no relationship between gender
and knowledge/attitudes toward IAS (Ansong and Pickering 2015;
Bardsley and Edwards-Jones 2006). Environmental group mem-
bers did have significantly different orientations than non-
members, being less accepting of IAS, supporting the view that
individuals affiliated to different interest groups such as recrea-
tional clubs and environmental or animal rights organizations may
have different perceptions and attitudes toward IAS and their
management (Shackleton et al. 2019b).
Understanding tourists’ perceptions and attitudes toward
IAS and their management is crucial for environmental managers
who wish to generate support from this group to help achieve
conservation outcomes (Mameno et al. 2020). Tourists constitute a
substantial body of individuals moving about the world, posing not
only an immediate biological threat (Melly and Hanrahan 2020),

but through their landscape and biota preferences also constituting
a substantial economic and ecological force that has implications
for IAS management in destinations.
The findings from this study provide empirical support for the
view that tourists often struggle to see IAS as a threat within a
destination (Greenaway et al. 2015). Ironically, although visitors
often travel to seek experiences associated with a high level of
naturalness or wildness, the landscapes that they encounter
(Karlsd´
ottir 2013; Urry 2002) may have large populations of
invasive species. They may remain unaware of environmental
problems such as IAS that significantly undermine the integrity of
the natural environment and biodiversity (Perrings et al. 2002). This
is important, as Rossi et al. (2022) revealed a link between visitors’
IAS knowledge and their willingness to support IAS management.
However, this study suggests that engaging tourists as supporters for
IAS management or eradication may be problematic when they have
“contrasting conservation narratives” (Zhang et al. 2021: 9) that do
not align with official IAS management initiatives.
Complicating any efforts to engage or educate tourists in IAS
management efforts is the heterogeneity of inbound visitor
markets. Our findings support the notion that human/nonhuman
relationships are not politically neutral and that all visitors to a
destination do not see spaces and places through the same lens;
there is no singular nature, only a diversity of natures
(McNaughten and Urry 1998). Our finding that attitudes toward
naturalness and IAS varied across different nationalities and
ethnicities suggests that visitors cannot be treated as one
homogenous cohort. In particular, the emergence of large tourist
markets from generating regions where there may be divergent
views of nature and of IAS poses challenges for conservation
managers wishing to engage with and draw upon the support of
these visitors (e.g., visitors from China, which before COVID-19
represented New Zealand’s second-largest international visitor
market and one of the most valuable in terms of holiday visitor
spend [Tourism New Zealand 2021]). Thus, understanding the
knowledge and attitudes of different types of visitors is important in
designing targeted and market-specific communication strategies
with a view to obtaining support across these potentially important
stakeholder groups in IAS management.
A limitation of this study was that it only captured tourists’ general
perceptions and attitudes toward IAS; there is a need to further
explore the underlying reasons for such perceptions and attitudes. It is
likely that in-depth qualitative approaches can be valuable in this
regard. While this study points to an East–West divide in terms of IAS
perceptions and attitudes among visitor groups, to address any
possibility of falling into a culturally essentialist interpretation of these
findings (Li et al. 2021), further in-depth qualitative research will be
valuable in ascertaining why such attitudes prevail.
There is a need to also consider tourists’ knowledge of IAS in
their home countries, along with their behavior within the
destination country (e.g., length of time in the destination and level
of exposure to environmental messaging regarding IAS) and how
this may impact upon their IAS perceptions and attitudes. Further
studies could explore visitors’ responses toward particular IAS
management approaches, particularly those related to IAS that are
perceived as tourist attractions within destinations.
