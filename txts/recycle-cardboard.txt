Almost all kiwis can now recycle pizza boxes and other cardboard from home. Just remove any food scraps and put your cardboard out for recycling. Pizza boxes are sorted at the recycling plant, where they are bailed, then pulped. The pulp is used to make new paper and cardboard products, like at a factory in Hawkes Bay, which turns recycled cardboard into fruit trays. So remove any food scraps and put your clean cardboard out for recycling. Get up to date on recycling rights.
