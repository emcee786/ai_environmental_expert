Abstract
Predator Free 2050 (PF2050) is a government initiative aiming to eradicate
selected invasive mammals (mustelids, rats, and possums) from New Zealand
(NZ) by 2050. Selecting which of 32 introduced mammal species to include has
received little evaluation, yet targeting a few species often results in perverse
ecological outcomes given interactions within the invasive guild. We explore
how PF2050 could be improved strategically by focusing on biodiversity out-
comes instead of selectively targeting invasives, using rodents as an example.
Current PF2050 targets include all rat species (Rattus exulans, R. norvegicus, and
R. rattus), but not the house mouse (Mus musculus). Mice can be as damag-
ing as rats when competition and predation are removed, negating benefits of
rat removal. Multirodent eradications are more cost-effective and prevent meso-
predator release. Using a case study, we show adding mice to a rat eradication
would raise costs modestly, comparing favorably to independent mouse eradica-
tion later, which would be riskier and more socially and economically costly than
the preceding rat eradication. Missing the opportunity to tackle all rodents simul-
taneously, leaving mice to multiply in numbers and impacts, could have serious
environmental and socioeconomic consequences. Naïve eradication strategies
neglecting ecological expertise risk biodiversity outcomes and NZ’s eradication
science reputation.

INTRODUCTION
Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) faces a biodiversity crisis.
At least 63 native species have become extinct since the
arrival of humans, and 4374 species are threatened or at
risk of extinction according to the NZ Threat Classification

torial; however, being an insular country with no native
terrestrial mammals apart from bats, the introduction
of invasive mammals has been particularly devastating
(Clout, 2001). There are 32 species of introduced mammals
in the wild in NZ (King & Forsyth, 2021), with diverse size

(from rodents to ungulates), habits (terrestrial to arboreal),
and diets (herbivorous, omnivorous, and carnivorous), of
which 14 species are widespread (Tables S1 and S2). In
addition to the ecological damage caused, some invasives
(e.g., Australian brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula
and domestic cat Felis catus) have profound impacts on
agriculture and human and livestock health (Clout, 2001).
Active management of established pests has two
approaches: eradication or control. Eradication involves
complete removal of the target population in a discrete
time interval; control aims to suppress the number of
pests to a target level and is done recurrently and in
perpetuity (Bomford & O’Brien, 1995). Eradication tech-
niques pioneered in NZ are now a major restoration tool
on islands worldwide (Spatz et al., 2022). In NZ, 117 off-
shore islands have been cleared of invasive mammals
(Russell & Broome, 2016), with strong outcomes for ecosys-
tem recovery (Towns, 2011; Prior et al., 2018). In addition
to true geographical islands, ring-fenced ecosanctuaries
(Innes et al., 2019) created with predator-resistant fences
have also benefited from mammal eradications, although
mouse reinvasion limits ecological recovery in some eco-
sanctuaries (Watts et al., 2022). On the North and South
Islands (hereafter mainland NZ), control programs are
implemented to reduce impacts of invasive mammals on
threatened species and ecosystems (Innes et al., 2023). Sus-
tained effort is key to sustaining benefits; thus, it is socially,
environmentally, and financially costly in the long term.
Further, resources are insufficient to treat all areas.
The Predator Free 2050 (PF2050) initiative was launched
by the NZ government in 2016 to eradicate mustelids
(Mustela spp.), rats (Rattus spp.), and possums from main-
land NZ by the year 2050 (Russell et al., 2015). PF2050
funds large-scale control and eradication trials, and devel-
opment of potential new tools. However, PF2050 has
been criticized for shortfalls in eradication technology,
insufficient finance, low scalability of existing tools, and
inadequate consideration of social and ecological com-
plexity, each of which erodes viability of the initiative
(King, 2023; Leathwick & Byrom, 2023; Linklater & Steer,
2018; Monks et al., 2023; Parkes et al., 2017; Peltzer et al.,
2019). National biosecurity, that is, safeguarding from
repeated international pest invasions, for example, has not
been assessed despite being a prerequisite for eradication
(Kennedy & Broome, 2019), and NZ’s ability to manage
pest reinvasions locally and regionally remains question-
able (Barron et al., 2023). Between 2016/17 and 2020/21
NZ$306.28 million has been spent under the Predator
Free umbrella, mostly on pest control which reduces to
NZ$212.28 million if investments in habitat restoration
and targeted biodiversity protection are subtracted (DOC,
2021). Investment in focused and strategically led erad-
ication exemplars is a very small aspect of the overall
investment. The national strategy (DOC, 2020) does not
address basic criteria for feasibility of eradication (Bom-
ford & O’Brien, 1995; Peltzer et al., 2019). We argue
that all eradication exemplars should do so, in order to
increase viability of the national goal. This and many
other strategic improvements are required. We explore
these wider strategic shortcomings using rodents as an
example.
Four species of invasive rodents are present in NZ.
Pacific rat or kiore (Rattus exulans) arrived first with Poly-
nesian settlers in the early 13th century; they have ongoing
impacts on native flora and fauna that did not evolve with
rats (Towns, 2009). Norway rats (R. norvegicus) arrived dur-
ing the 18th century on European ships, and house mice
(Mus musculus; hereafter mouse or mice) and ship rats
(R. rattus) a century later (Veale et al., 2018). Since intro-
duction to NZ, mice became more ecologically widespread
than in Eurasia because they encountered fewer com-
petitors and predators (Murphy & Nathan, 2021). Mouse
distribution and abundance are influenced by the presence
of larger, dominant predators and competitors, for exam-
ple, rats and stoats (Mustela erminea) (Watts et al., 2022).
PF2050 targets all three rat species, but not mice (DOC,
2020; Tompkins, 2018). Such reductionist management
often has perverse ecological outcomes given complex
interactions among species; foreseeing such responses
should be embedded in any eradication strategy (Glen
et al., 2013; Zavaleta et al., 2001), but particularly for
PF2050 (Peltzer et al., 2019). Moreover, because mouse
impacts can be as dramatic as rat impacts, mice and rats
are routinely targeted simultaneously in control programs
and island rodent eradications (see below).
It is not clear why mice were excluded from the PF2050
goal. Beyond a small survey of 19 stakeholders (Tomp-
kins, 2018), there is no published account of the process
by which possums, rats, and mustelids were chosen. For
example, while kiore are included in the goal, this species
has localized ecological effects and has cultural signifi-
cance in some areas (Towns, 2009), whereas mice arguably
have a more significant impact at a national scale, a con-
cern that was noted by ecosanctuary survey participants at
the time. A robust analysis of the species for inclusion in
such a significant national initiative could have considered
multidimensional political, social (Liang, 2023), cultural,
and financial aspects of the campaign as well as the prac-
tical aspects of planning for eradication, ensuring that the
consequences of eradicating select species are evaluated.
Indeed, a major criticism of the PF2050 campaign to
date is that desired outcomes for biodiversity have not
been clearly articulated (Leathwick & Byrom, 2023; Innes
et al., 2023). Given the known impacts of mice on NZ’s
native flora and fauna, their impacts on biodiversity loss
globally, and their propensity for mesopredator release

(see below), this is a major oversight and an opportunity
missed. We argue that focusing on the desired outcomes for
biodiversity (part of any feasibility study as recommended
by eradication best practice) would have clearly high-
lighted mice as a potentially significant issue to address
in the PF2050 campaign. Moreover, the exclusion of mice
highlights how a focus on top-down control and eradica-
tion methods is often employed without reference to the
potentially stronger bottom-up effects of resource avail-
ability (King, 2023). Mice are a driving component of
stoat diets (White & King, 2006), so removal of mice (as
a primary prey of stoats) is likely to be a critical com-
ponent of the eventual eradication of that species (by
reducing primary food resource availability and hence
stoat survival), especially considering limitations of cur-
rent and near-future tools. Targeting mice alongside rats
within the PF2050 context is an extraordinary opportu-
nity in ecological, financial, and social terms, capitalizing
on the advantages of multispecies eradication strategies,
particularly given the same eradication approach is com-
monly used for all rodents (Howald et al., 2007; Table 1).
Below, we outline current knowledge on impacts of mice
in global and national contexts, providing insights from
recent research. We then discuss the prospects of eradi-
cating mice or controlling them in perpetuity, and lessons
from global island rodent eradications. Finally, a case study
illustrates how expanding rat eradication to all-rodent
eradication compares favorably financially, augmenting
social and ecological benefits.

HOUSE MOUSE IMPACTS
2.1
Global impacts
Mice, with a global distribution second only to humans,
are a major threat to biodiversity, economies and human
health, hence their inclusion on the IUCN’s list “100 of
the world’s worst invasive species” (Lowe et al., 2000).
As opportunistic omnivores, mice directly and indirectly
impact natural systems via consumption of seeds, plants,
and a wide range of animals, often consuming propor-
tionally more animal than plant matter (Shiels & Pitt,
2014). Known for their preference for invertebrates, mouse
predation can have profound consequences given the cru-
cial roles of invertebrates in ecosystem functioning, for
example, pollination (St Clair, 2011). Moreover, where mice
have depleted available invertebrates, they often exploit
larger prey such as seabirds (Caravaggi et al., 2019). Indeed,
dramatic examples come from islands where mice are
either the only introduced mammal or the only species not
yet eradicated (Angel et al., 2009). For example, on Gough
Island an estimated 2 million eggs and chicks are preyed
on by mice annually (Caravaggi et al., 2019); a 2021 eradi-
cation attempt yielded dramatic increases in 2022 hatching
success for several species of seabirds (RSPB, 2022). On
Marion Island, early signs of mouse attacks on seabirds
were recorded in 2003, 12 years after cats were eradicated;
today mice regularly attack and kill seabird chicks and
adults (Connan et al., 2023). Similarly, on Midway Atoll

mice were first recorded attacking seabirds in 2015, 19 years
after ship rat eradication (Duhr et al., 2019). Collectively,
these reports emphasize the remarkably short timeframes
within which mice can change diet, and that novel ecolog-
ical impacts play out years after removal of predators or
competitors.
Mice also impact human systems (Nghiem et al., 2013).
Their impacts on agriculture are well known globally;
crop consumption and contamination of storage areas and
facilities translate to multimillion-dollar losses (Stenseth
et al., 2003). In Australia, mouse plagues have become
a regular feature in grain-producing regions over several
decades, with densities reaching a staggering 2716 mice/ha
(Singleton et al., 2007). The advent of “conservation agri-
culture” in Australia, which is more environmentally
sensitive and economically viable, may generate higher
mouse populations via less disturbance of burrows and
increased cover and food supply, necessitating new pest
management frameworks (Ruscoe et al., 2021). Mouse
impacts on food security are linked to global warming and
climate instability (Singleton et al., 2010), with impacts
expected to worsen.
Mice exacerbate human stress and fear (Randler et al.,
2012) and are also vectors and reservoirs of human and
livestock pathogens, transmitting viral, bacterial, rick-
ettsial, and parasitic diseases, including toxoplasmosis,
leptospirosis, salmonellosis, and campylobacteriosis, as
well as endo- and ectoparasites such as tapeworms and
fleas (Blackwell, 1981; Charrel & de Lamballerie, 2010).
Among commensal rodents, mice are typically closest to
humans in both urban and rural environments: multiple
pathogenic bacteria associated with human diseases have
been found in mice (Williams et al., 2018).
2.2
New Zealand impacts
The abundance of mice in NZ is predictably variable.
Studies describe a range of densities with a maximum of
157 mice/ha in a fenced ecosanctuary where other mam-
mals had been eradicated (Goldwater, 2007). In native
forest ecosystems, mouse populations are driven by seed
production (King, 1983). Dominant tree species in these
forests exhibit synchronized seeding (masting) events that
often produce dramatic increases in population densities
(Ruscoe et al., 2005). Similar relationships occur in mid-to
high-altitude native grassland ecosystems, where abun-
dance of invertebrates and lizards is inversely related to
mouse abundance (Norbury et al., 2023).
Mouse diets in NZ are varied but dominated by plants
and invertebrates (Murphy & Nathan, 2021). Evidence of
mice as predators of larger and sometimes threatened prey
in NZ first emerged in the 1970s. A study of mouse ecology
on Mana Island, where mice were the only mammalian
predator, found that mice ate native lizards, with skinks
comprising up to 20% of the diet (Bellingham, 1990). Mouse
eradication on Mana enabled the threatened MacGregor’s
skink (Oligosoma macgregori), goldstripe gecko (Woodwor-
thia chrysosiretica), and Cook Strait giant weta (Deinacrida
rugosa) to recover (Newman, 1994). Emerging NZ evidence
suggests mice can not only suppress invertebrate popu-
lations but also influence their body size (Watts et al.,
2022).
While impacts on threatened taxa are generally cryp-
tic and unreported, mice have been recorded preying on
large (>25 cm length) threatened skinks, causing a strong
decline in survival compared to a population protected
from mice (Norbury et al., 2014). Mice also prey on other
threatened lizards and birds (Michelsen-Heath & Gaze,
2007). Despite these reports, most mouse impacts on bio-
diversity in NZ remain unknown, as threatened species
are neither monitored in tandem with invasive predator
dynamics nor with sufficient frequency and resolution to
clarify the relationship.
Climate change also has potential to exacerbate mouse
impacts in natural and agricultural ecosystems in NZ
(Holland et al., 2015). Should agricultural practices change
in favor of either arable or greater sustained vegeta-
tion cover, farmers could anticipate increased mouse
abundance and impacts, as in Australia (Ruscoe et al.,
2021). Any increase in distribution and abundance of mice
has implications for agriculture and human health in
NZ given demonstrated links between mice and zoonotic
infections of public health concern (Morand et al., 2015).

MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS
3.1
Mice in the absence of predators and
competitors
Ring- and peninsula-fenced ecosanctuaries provide exper-
imental arenas to assess how mice respond to removal
of other mammalian predators because of their ability
to reinvade these ecosanctuaries (Watts et al., 2022). In
Tawharanui Open Sanctuary, mouse population indices
increased from zero prior to eradication (of all other inva-
sive mammals) to more than 180 mice/100 trap nights
(Goldwater et al., 2012). Mouse body mass at Tawharanui
also increased over time, suggesting that mice in NZ (usu-
ally < 25 g) potentially respond similarly to mice on some
subantarctic islands where maximum mouse mass (in
the absence of other mammals) surpasses the 50 g mark
(Goldwater et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2003). Whether this
increase in body size observed in NZ is driven by greater
life expectancy following removal of predators, or resultant
 1755263x, 2024, 2, Downloaded from https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12996 by Ministry Of Health, Wiley Online Library on [09/05/2024].

SAMANIEGO et al.
from rapid natural selection for larger individuals due to
mesopredator release, has not been determined. Consid-
ering that on subantarctic islands mice prey on seabirds
300 times their body mass (Cuthbert & Hilton, 2004), it
is reasonable to expect dramatic shifts in the predator-
prey ecology of mice post-PF2050 (Norbury et al., 2023).
Would mouse control in the absence of predators and com-
petitors be sufficient to maintain their ecological impacts
at or below current levels? Notwithstanding the fact that
we currently lack mouse control tools that are suitable
for sustained and high frequency use, it would certainly
be more difficult and costly than at present, as mice are
likely to expand ecological niches (for example, climb
more; Innes et al., 2018), and in doing so achieve higher
densities (Goldwater et al., 2012). Even in circumstances
where competitors such as rats are only being controlled
as opposed to eradicated, mesopredator release in mice
has been observed, resulting in the suppression of native
lizards (Monks et al., 2023).
Mouse populations are largely bottom-up regulated by
food availability (Choquenot & Ruscoe, 2000), so food
resources (and nesting habitat) would likely increase if
competitors are removed, enabling exploitation of previ-
ously unavailable resources (Bridgman et al., 2018). For
example, mouse densities reach 50/ha on mainland NZ
with other predatory mammals present (Ruscoe, 2001).
In contrast, densities after mammal eradications in NZ
have increased to > 150 mice/ha (Goldwater, 2007). On
islands where mice lack competitors and predators, den-
sities of > 1000 mice/ha have been recorded (Polito et al.,
2022). In dry agricultural areas of Australia, despite a
diverse assemblage of potential predators of mice, densities
have been documented at 2716/ha (Singleton et al., 2007),
illustrating the degree to which dynamics are bottom-up
(cf. top-down) driven.
3.2
Mouse eradications
Only recently have mice received increasing attention by
conservationists. Angel et al. (2009) suggested two rea-
sons for this: scant knowledge of described impacts on
charismatic fauna and perceived higher failure rates for
mouse eradications compared to rat eradications. Both
appear to be the result of mice being understudied and
therefore underestimated for decades (see above), and
not being explicitly targeted (or even detected) during
early rat eradications (Broome et al., 2019). Indeed, many
rodent eradication failures are explained by human error,
which once corrected often result in eradication success
(Samaniego et al., 2021). Fine-tuning best practice for mice
was key to improving this track record, questioning the
mindset that “mice are too difficult to eradicate” (Broome
et al., 2019).
Up to 2019, mice had been eradicated from 59 islands
worldwide, including 28 NZ islands (Broome et al., 2019).
Encouraged by this trend, mouse eradications on large
islands, some inhabited, are being planned, either tar-
geting only mice (where no other mammals are present)
or as part of multispecies eradications (Table 2). Despite
ever-increasing island size and complexity, the eradication
success rate for mice has increased notably (Spatz et al.,
2022) and has been higher than for rat eradications since
2005 (Samaniego et al., 2021). Conversely, pest-fenced,
mainland ecosanctuaries have recurrent issues managing
mice, perhaps due to small juvenile mice passing through
the fence, although confirming that reinvasion rather than
incomplete eradication is the main cause requires mark-
recapture studies (Goldwater et al., 2012; Innes et al., 2019).
Once inside, mice breed rapidly and become abundant
because their usual predators and competitors are missing;
at Maungatautari (central North Island), mice removed
about half of the litter invertebrates, probably to the detri-
ment of native fauna relying on this resource (Watts et al.,
2022).
NZ researchers have recently begun addressing man-
agement of mice (Hitchmough et al., 2016), highlighting
a limited understanding of mouse ecology and limitations
of existing control tools to protect threatened species and
ecosystems. One driver of this limitation is the extreme
paucity of funding for developing control tools for non-
Predator Free pest predators, due in part to diversion
of a significant proportion of Department of Conser-
vation (DOC; the NZ government agency responsible
for managing biodiversity on public lands) funds into
PF2050 associated work (DOC, 2021). Other than improved
mammal-resistant fences, there are currently no approved
tools for large-scale, long-term mouse control with accept-
able flow-on effects for mainland NZ, as brodifacoum
(the most effective rodenticide for mice) is biopersistent
(Howald et al., 2007) and its use is highly restricted. One
aim of PF2050 was to incentivize investment in new tools
and innovations for pest eradications at scale, which pro-
vides a compelling argument for inclusion of mice as part
of any multispecies eradication campaign.
3.3
Multispecies eradications
Eradicating mice and rats simultaneously is a logical
approach because it is cost-effective, less socially taxing
(as every human structure needs treatment), and the only
way of avoiding the documented undesired flow-on effects
of removing rats only (Innes et al., 2023). In fact, all
global records for mouse eradications are examples of mul-
tispecies eradications (Table 1). The largest uninhabited
island cleared of mice is Macquarie (128 km2); the largest
inhabited island is Lord Howe (14.5 km2) (Table 1). South

Georgia Island (3528 km2) is usually excluded from global
statistics because it was not a standard rodent eradica-
tion (baiting done in phases, with large glaciers excluded
from treatment); however, both rats and mice were eradi-
cated from the 1068 km2 rodent-occupied part of the island
(Martin & Richardson, 2017), an order of magnitude larger
than Macquarie Island. Ongoing planning for Auckland
Island (460 km2) targets all invasive mammals (mice, cats,
and pigs Sus scrofa), because “Eradicating all three target
species is the only way to fully realise the benefits and avoid
detrimental trophic shift responses” (Horn et al., 2022).
These are the same reasons why the projects in Table 1
never considered excluding mice from their eradication
operations.
When mice are not eradicated alongside rats and other
invasive predators, mouse populations increase and dis-
perse at best, and also change diet and habits resulting
in rat-like impacts at worst—lessons learned from early,
selective eradications (e.g., cases in Veitch et al., 2019 and
previous editions). These lessons prompted subsequent
eradication operations to remedy mouse impacts, incur-
ring additional costs and risks to nontarget species with
repeated toxin use (given aerial baiting using rodenticides
is the preferred eradication method for any invasive rodent;
Howald et al., 2007).
Biosecurity measures to prevent or limit reinvasion by
mice after eradication are similar to those for rats and
mustelids; prevention of arrival is vastly preferable and
more cost-efficient than searching for reinvaders (Kennedy
& Broome, 2019). A variety of detection devices and tools
must be distributed widely in likely habitat (within and
outside eradication zones) and maintained with fresh lure.
Trained rodent dogs detect both rats and mice (Gsell et al.,
2010), and genetic tools can be used to query if individuals
are survivors or reinvaders (depending on genetic diver-
sity). Unmanaged, mice interfere with monitoring devices
set for other species, removing bait and triggering devices
including cameras, increasing costs and compromising
rapid detection and elimination of rats (Wilson et al., 2018).

eradication and theoretical scenarios targeting rats and
mice in separate operations. The brief descriptions of the
islands and the eradication operation are based on Griffiths
et al. (2015).
The Rangitoto-Motutapu complex (two islands artifi-
cially connected) is 3 km offshore from the largest city
(Auckland) in NZ. Rangitoto is forested and Motutapu is
dominated by pastoral farmland with areas of regenerat-
ing forest and wetlands. In 2009, rodents (all three rat
species and mice) were eradicated from the island com-
plex (3842 ha) at the start of a multispecies eradication
operation, which also eradicated cats, rabbits (Oryctolagus
cuniculus), hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), and stoats,
that is, all eight species of invasive mammals present
(Table 2). The main rodent eradication method was the
aerial application of brodifacoum bait, with nearly 1000
bait stations inside buildings as a complementary method.
Rangitoto-Motutapu are representative of mainland NZ
in that they include native forest, farmland, and human-
made structures, along with a common suite of introduced
predators including rats and mice. On Motutapu, farm-
ing operations were suspended during the eradication
operation and stock were removed from the island for
approximately four months.
Although the efficiencies and savings of eradicating
all rodent species simultaneously were clear from the
planning process (Griffiths et al., 2015), there were, in
theory, three potential management scenarios: (1) rat erad-
ication, (2) rodent (rat and mouse) eradication, and (3)
two separate eradications (rat, then mouse when deemed
necessary) (Table 3). A rat eradication, ignoring mice,
would resemble the current PF2050 approach; however,
it was never considered a viable option despite poten-
tial savings of 22.5% (Table 3), mainly because leaving
mice behind would negate benefits of rat eradication,
and biosecurity for rats would be extremely difficult and
costly with mice present, eventually negating initial sav-
ings. Instead, a rodent (rat and mouse) eradication was
implemented given that moderate operational and cost
increases (Table 3) were expected to yield vastly better
long-term social, economic, and environmental outcomes.
In practice, this meant implementing similar procedures
(as for rat eradication) to the highest standard, and carry-
ing out a third bait drop (which also targeted the larger
target species). Finally, under Scenario 3 (separate, inde-
pendent eradications), a subsequent mouse eradication
would have faced higher operational risk and been more
expensive and more socially taxing than the preceding rat
eradication, as mice are expected to be more abundant after
rat removal. We estimate this approach would have raised
the cost of clearing all rodents by about 77% (Table 3).
Indeed, Griffiths et al. (2015) noted that “When compared to
other projects that targeted the same [eight] species but indi-
vidually, we estimate the Rangitoto and Motutapu project
to have cost less than 50% of the total potential cost if each
species had been removed in a discrete operation. Logisti-
cal efficiencies created by condensing several operations into
one and the use of eradication and detection techniques that
targeted multiple species are credited as having the greatest
influence on the increased efficiencies observed.”
We identified four risk categories in separating rat and
mouse eradications (Scenario 3).
Financial
Costs for planning and preparing aerial toxin applica-
tions average 69% (11%–142%, n = 11) of the implemen-
tation costs (Holmes et al., 2015), which would occur
twice (years to decades apart) under Scenario 3. Like-
wise, recruitment and training of field staff, which is
expensive due to the specialist expertise required, would
need to be repeated. Infrastructure and communica-
tion investments (e.g., offices, vehicles, IT, GIS) are also
lost between eradications under Scenario 3 as in New
Zealand such investments are often rapidly redeployed for
other uses. Biosecurity costs after rat eradication would
also increase significantly as a result of interference by
mice.
Technical
Mice, even at low density, interfere with bait, traps, and
detection devices, which complicates rat eradication and
compromises post-rat-eradication biosecurity monitoring.
Rat biosecurity protocols in the presence of mice would
need to account for frequent mistaken reports of “rats”
constantly triggering costly incursion responses by highly
experienced staff (to discern between rat and mouse
sign).
Social
Independent eradications require significantly more toxin,
with repeated, prolonged site access and restrictions on
human activities. Farming activities, for example, would
cease twice under Scenario 3. This poses a risk to the chal-
lenging acquisition of social license and permissions to
access private properties and would increase the duration
of risk to domestic pets. Stakeholders would be disap-
pointed if outcomes of the rat eradication do not meet
expectations due to subsequent mouse impacts on liveli-
hoods and wildlife. Lost trust and toxin aversion could thus
impede or compromise a second eradication.
Environmental
On Rangitoto-Motutapu, 147 tons of brodifacoum bait were
used. The amount of bait required would at least double

DISCUSSION
Our aim was to examine the strategic shortcomings of a
laudable national conservation goal: Predator Free 2050 in
NZ. Invasive rodents are a case in point for the PF2050
campaign, acknowledging other taxa warrant equal atten-
tion. Focusing on the desired outcomes for biodiversity
would have—right from the inception of the campaign—
shone a spotlight on mice as a key threatening process
for NZ’s native taxa. By highlighting the lack of inclu-
sion of mice in PF2050, and demonstrating how cost-
effective their inclusion would be, we have suggested how
PF2050 could be improved strategically. Doing so would
give more explicit consideration to the wider ecosystem
implications, including biodiversity outcomes, instead of
selectively targeting invasives. PF2050 undoubtedly must
be improved, and what is needed, both at the outset

SAMANIEGO et al.
and on an ongoing basis, is a robust assessment of fea-
sibility, assumptions, biodiversity goals, current results,
and delivery of outcomes. This observation is relevant to
eradication attempts worldwide. Published recommenda-
tions on species removal in a whole-ecosystem context
have been available for over 20 years (e.g., Zavaleta et al.,
2001).
In addition to having the potential to undo many envi-
ronmental benefits of removing larger invasive mammals,
a reductionist approach can also make subsequent con-
trol or eradication of other invasives more difficult if
social license needs to be relitigated. The consequences for
human health and well-being, primary industries, and the
total financial cost, can be significant. These consequences
highlight an obligation—particularly when spending pub-
lic funds—to engage stakeholders early in the process, and
to update and refine approaches in real time as short-
comings are revealed and as new information becomes
available (Towns, 2011).
Based on our literature review and case study, we have
four recommendations.
First, improve leadership. Our assessment has high-
lighted the important leadership role that national biodi-
versity agencies should play both in determining conser-
vation goals and in monitoring progress toward achieving
them. The Department of Conservation currently has
responsibility for much of NZ’s biodiversity management,
and their leadership is vital in applying existing prioritiza-
tion systems and eradication expertise, managing prioriti-
zation conflicts between eradication and other strategies,
formally planning and monitoring pest and biodiversity
abundance to agreed national standards, and even ensur-
ing that eradication terminology is universally understood
across multiple stakeholder groups.
Second, correct the approach. It is vital to instigate an
outcomes-driven conservation approach to PF2050 and
similar large-scale eradications of invasive species glob-
ally (i.e., management of all key pressures to achieve
clearly defined ecological outcomes), with robust, detailed
and ecologically informed consideration of how different
pests—including mice—should be targeted across land-
scapes. Measurement of biodiversity and other outcomes
should be prioritized ahead of body counts of mammal
predators. The current focus on “predators” has resulted
in little to no research or operational focus on how ecosys-
tems are impacted by nontarget pests (e.g., ungulates, pigs,
cats, dogs, hedgehogs—and mice, not to mention other
biotic threats such as plant pathogens and invasive inver-
tebrates). Focusing solely on the eradication of a subset of
pests in the long term, at the cost of addressing threatened
species and ecosystem needs in the short-term, places vul-
nerable biodiversity at unacceptable risk of loss. A critical
lesson is that selection of target pests should be appropriate
to the biodiversity gains being sought.
Third, reevaluate species to target. Mice (among other
species) should be considered for inclusion as an explicit
PF2050 target species where biodiversity benefits can
be expected, aiming for their eradication alongside rats.
Large-scale projects on mainland NZ, particularly around
urban areas, require new tools that can address such scales
and realities, whether a single- or multispecies eradica-
tion is implemented. For islands where current tools can
be applied, adding mice as an explicit target species for
PF2050 requires extra upfront planning, effort, and fund-
ing (varying regionally according to site complexity, inhab-
itation, and techniques used). However, past multispecies
operations (e.g., our case study) have confirmed that such
scenarios are preferable when compared to the alterna-
tive: two or more higher-risk separate eradications costing
potentially >100% extra. Aerial eradications are more cost-
efficient; ground operations (e.g., in urban areas) are more
expensive and carry higher operational risks. However,
effective biosecurity must be resolved and funded prior
to embarking on eradication if potential successes are to
be sustained (Kennedy & Broome, 2019). We acknowl-
edge that including mice would not be without risk:
rodent eradication campaigns that include mice require
implementation to the highest standard and can be more
protracted, and detecting and managing reinvaders require
extra effort. However, similar biosecurity issues already
exist for rat eradications and could be addressed with rel-
atively minor modifications to include mice, which would
make monitoring easier and cheaper in the long term.
Finally, engage with eradication experts. It is critical that
NZ incorporates invasion science expertise and knowledge
into PF2050. Such expertise and established standards
of eradication—including robust feasibility planning and
review—have been essential steps in past successful erad-
ications and have been globally recognized in the form of
internationally sought feasibility and operational reviews
from the Department of Conservation’s Island Eradica-
tion Advisory Group (Brown et al., 2023; Cromarty et al.,
2002). With such recognition comes a responsibility to
ensure that national goals are informed by robust, scien-
tifically sound expertise, and such expertise should have
been involved early in the planning of the PF2050 cam-
paign. As a recognized leader in pest eradications, NZ will
influence global pest management with decisions made in
tackling ambitious conservation goals like PF2050. Naïve
eradication strategies that neglect ecological expertise risk
failing to achieve biodiversity outcomes and compromise
NZ’s eradication science reputation.
