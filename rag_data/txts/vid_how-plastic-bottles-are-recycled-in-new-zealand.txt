Almost all Kiwis can now recycle plastic bottles. Number one, two and five from home. Just give them a rinse of their duty, then recycle them. Plastic bottles are sorted at the recycling plant before they are bailed, shredded, melted and recycled into new containers. Like at a factory in Wellington, which turns them into fruit punnets, don't forget to check the number, then rinse duty bottles and recycle. Get up to date on recycling right.
